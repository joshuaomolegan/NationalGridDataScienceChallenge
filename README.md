# NationalGridDataScienceChallenge
A 2 data science challenge hosted by the National Grid and Generating Genius from 21/12/2020 - 22/12/2020. We were given data about 100 cable sealing ends in the UK and worked in teams of 4 to analyse the data and present an appropriate strategy to determine which sealing ends needed to be replaced.  
  
This repository contains a certificate of participation, my teams presentation and the Jupyter Notebook used to preprocess and analyse the data.
